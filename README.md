# fintech-transaction-system
A backend microservices system to simulate financial transactions. Built with Java, Sprint Boot, PostgreSQL, and Docker. 

## üöÄ Key Faetures (Planned & In Progress)
- [x] Account microservice (create & retrieve accounts)
- [ ] Transaction microservice (transfer funds between accounts)
- [ ] Balance microservice (track and update balances)
- [ ] Notification microservice (send transaction alerts)
- [ ] Kafka-based event-driven communication
- [ ] Docker-based deployment
- [ ] Swagger API documentation
- [ ] Github Actions CI/CD pipeline

## üß± Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Apache Kafka
- Docker & Docker Compose
- JUnit + Mockito
- Github Actions (optional)

## üìê System Architecture 
The system is designed using a microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with others through Apache Kafka (planned). Each service also has its own database for data isolation and scalability. 

### Key Components:
- **Account Service** - Manages account creation and retrieval
- **Transaction Service** - Handles fund transfers between accounts
- **Balance Service** - Tracks and updates user balance
- **Notification Service** - Sneds alerts on successful transactions
- **Kafka Broker** - Enables event-driven communication between services
- **PostgreSQL** - Each microservice uses its own instance for persistence

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run (for Account Service)
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/chanpt/fintech-transaction-system.git
cd fintech-transaction-system/account-service

# Start PostgreSQL (if you have Docker installed)
docker run --name fintech-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -e POSTGRES_USER=finuser -e POSTGRES_DB=fintech -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# Run the Spring Boot app
./mvnw spring-boot:run

```

## üì¨ API Endpoints
### Account Microservice
| Method | Endpoint          | Description          |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| POST   | `/accounts`       | Create new account   |
| GET    | `/accounts`       | Get all accounts     |
| GET    | `/accounts/{id}`  | Get account details  |
| PUT    | `/accounts/{id}`  | Update account       |
| DELETE | `/accounts/{id}`  | Delete account       |


## üìå Status
Currently building and documenting the system
- Account service is working and deployed locally
- More services and Kafka integration are planned
