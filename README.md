# FinTech Transaction System - Microservices Architecture

## Overview

This is a backend microservices project simulating a basic FinTech transaction system.  
Built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**, it demonstrates event-driven architecture and service separation.

### üîÑ Recent Update

The system now includes support for **post-trade account types** (e.g., BROKERAGE, CUSTODIAN, CLEARING) as a foundational step toward modeling post-trade operations like settlement and reconciliation.  
Balances remain managed within the account service to keep the architecture simple and maintainable.

## üöÄ Key Faetures 
### ‚úÖ Account Management
- Create and manage accounts
- Support for post-trade `accountType` (e.g., `BROKERAGE`, `CLEARING`, `CUSTODIAN`)
- Each account includes a `balance` field for simplicity

### üí∏ Transactions
- Create transactions with sender and receiver accounts
- Deduct and credit balances accordingly
- Uses Kafka to publish transaction events

### üì¨ Event-Based Architecture
- Kafka topic: `balance-update-topic` for balance change events
- Future Kafka events: `account-created`, `trade-confirmed`, `settlement-completed`


## üß± Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL (relational database)
- Apache Kafka (event streaming)
- Docker & Docker Compose (containerization)
- JUnit + Mockito (Unit Testing)
- Maven (build tool)
- Github Actions (optional)



## üìê System Architecture 
The system is designed using a microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with others through Apache Kafka. Each service also has its own database for data isolation and scalability. 

### Key Components:
- **Account Service** ‚Äì Manages account creation and retrieval. Now supports `accountType` (BROKERAGE, CUSTODIAN, etc.).
- **Transaction Service** ‚Äì Handles fund transfers between accounts and publishes transaction events.
- **Balance Service** ‚Äì Listens for events and adjusts user balances. (WIP for decoupled balance tracking)
- **Kafka Broker** ‚Äì Enables asynchronous, event-driven communication between services.
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Each microservice has its own PostgreSQL instance for data persistence.
  
## üîß Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- [Java 17+](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  
## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run 
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/chanpt/fintech-transaction-system.git
cd fintech-transaction-system

# Start PostgreSQL (if you have Docker installed)
docker run --name fintech-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -e POSTGRES_USER=finuser -e POSTGRES_DB=fintech -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# Run Everything via Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```
```bash
# Run the Spring Boot app
# Run for account service
cd account-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```


```bash
# Run for transaction service
cd transaction-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

```bash
# Run for balance service
cd transaction-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## üì¨ API Endpoints
### Account Microservice
| Method | Endpoint          | Description          |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| POST   | `/accounts`       | Create new account   |
| GET    | `/accounts`       | Get all accounts     |
| GET    | `/accounts/{id}`  | Get account details  |
| PUT    | `/accounts/{id}`  | Update account       |
| DELETE | `/accounts/{id}`  | Delete account       |

### Transaction Microservice
| Method | Endpoint             | Description             |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| POST   | `/transactions`      | Create new transaction  |
| GET    | `/transactions`      | Get all transaction     |
| GET    | `/transactions/{id}` | Get transaction by ID   |

### Balance Microservice
| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                  |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| GET    | `/balance/{accountNumber}`  | Get balance by acount number |

## üß™ Testing
- Unit-tested using JUnit 5 + Mockito
- Swagger UI / Postman

## üìå Status
Currently building and documenting the system. The project is under active development with core services already functional.

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- `account-service`, `transaction-service`, and `balance-service` are deployed and operational
- Balance is updated through Kafka-based event-driven communication after each transaction
- `account-service` now supports post-trade account types (e.g., BROKERAGE, CLEARING, CUSTODIAN)

### üîÑ In Progress
- Kafka event schemas and documentation
- Expanded test coverage and sample API requests
- API documentation and OpenAPI (Swagger) integration

### üöß Planned
- `settlement-service` to simulate post-trade lifecycle (confirmations, cash movements)
- `position-service` for securities holdings per account
- Kafka events for trade creation, settlement confirmation, and reconciliation
